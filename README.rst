This is the uncertainties Python package.

The current version of the branches in this repository are 
bleeding-edge, but they are *working* versions that passed all the tests
for all the supported versions of Python.

The master branch is for Python 2.5+, while the master_python2.3 branch 
is for Python 2.3 and 2.4.
