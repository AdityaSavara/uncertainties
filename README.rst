GitHub
------

The ``release`` branch is for Python 2.7+ (including Python 3+ through
``2to3``), while the ``release_python2.3`` branch is for Python 2.3 to
2.6 (with unit tests only run with Python 2.6).


``master*`` branches in the Github repository are bleeding-edge, and do not necessarily pass the tests. The ``master`` and ``master_python2.3`` are the latest, relatively stable versions (while other ``master*`` branches are more experimental).

Other branches might be present in the GitHub repository, but they are
also temporary and represent work in progress that does not necessarily run
properly yet.
